      <p><strong>{t('terms.text')}12. Assumption of Risk; Limitation of Liability</strong></p>

      <p>{t('terms.text')}You acknowledge that the Site and the Services, and your use of the Site and the Services contain certain risks, including without limitation the following risks: <strong>{t('terms.text')}That any Services you interact with are entirely your own responsibility and liability, and we are not a party to Protocol; at any time, your access to your digital assets may be suspended or terminated or there may be a delay in your access or use of your digital assets which may result in the digital assets diminishing in value; and the Services may be suspended or terminated for any or no reason, which may limit your access to your digital assets. </strong>{t('terms.text')}Accordingly, you expressly agree that you assume all risk in connection with your access and use of the Site and Services.</p>

      <p><strong>{t('terms.text')}13. Limitations as Allowed by Law</strong></p>

      <p>{t('terms.text')}Some states, provinces and other jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion and limitations of certain implied warranties, or the exclusion or limitation of incidental or consequential damages, so the above limitations or exclusions may not apply to you.

      <p><strong>{t('terms.text')}15. Severability</strong></p>

      <p>{t('terms.text')}In the event that any of the provisions of this Agreement are held by a court or other tribunal of competent jurisdiction to be unenforceable, such provisions shall be limited or eliminated to the minimum extent necessary so that these terms and conditions shall otherwise remain in full force and effect.</p>

      <p><strong>{t('terms.text')}16. Governing Law and Jurisdiction</strong></p>

      <p>{t('terms.text')}This Agreement is entered into in Singapore and shall be governed by, and construed in accordance with, the laws of Singapore.
